Development Code challenge!
Welcome to Datenworks summoner code challenge, this is a code challenge that you will need to use some data, combining them and show some output information.

About the Challenge
You have two data files in CSV format. Those files contain statistics about League of Legends champions.

We need to know from the strongest to the weakest order, the name and the DPS of each champion. Do not print any other information and make sure there are no duplicates.

The Formula to calculate the Damage Per Second(DPS) is:
DPS = ATTACK_DAMAGE * ATTACK_SPEED

Requirements:
Write a documentation to explain how to execute it;
Evaluation Method
Your code will be under review of the Datenworks Engineering team.

What we will consider on this evaluation:

Performance
Unit Tests
Isolation of responsibilities
Software Engineering concerns (cohesion, reusability, etc)
Feel free to implement it the way you feel more confortable :)

GOOD LUCK!
